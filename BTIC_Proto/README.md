# Prototypes
| Prototype Number  | Change Log | File to Run |
| ------------- | ------------- |--------------|
| BTIC_Proto1   | Prototype code for the rover following the aruco tag with opencv. This was upgraded to 1280x720 at 10fps from 640x480 at 5fps.  | BTIC_Proto/Testing_grounds_for_class_aruco.py |
| BTIC_Proto2   | Includes the addition of following aruco tags with an x offset, with the ability to see multiple tags at once. Also upgraded to lattepanda, which increased resolution to 4k at 20fps.  | BTIC_Proto/Testing_grounds_for_class_arucoV2.py | 
| BTIC_Proto3   | Added localization to the autonomy code and added an rtmp camera connected to the lattepanda for autonomy. | BTIC_Proto/Testing_grounds_for_class_arucoV3.py | 
| BTIC_Proto4   | Added the GUI V4 to the Prototype Rover code from Prototype 3. | BTIC_Proto/Testing_grounds_for_class_arucoV4.py | 
| BTIC_Proto5*  | Currently under construction. This will be implementing the new Arduino controls compatable with the motor/actuator board and motherboard. | BTIC_Proto/Testing_grounds_for_class_arucoV5.py
